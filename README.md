# wasm-rust-pres
Slides for WASM, Rust, and the State of Async/Await.

On November 13th at 3:00am, I gave a presentation on using WebAssemebly to write backend web applications. The presentation and demos are based on the much-larger website/knowledgebase I wrote (that implements versioning, a custom database controller, and a routing graph, among other things). The original meetup link can be found [here](https://www.meetup.com/utah-rust/events/273757338/) â€“ The slides are also [availiable online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cGBil9FRQVijJ5XCWkBS9AMJXsKHvaPDNGFb3IueWQA/edit?usp=sharing) for your convinience.

Once the recording has been uploaded, I'll add the recorded talk.
