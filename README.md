# wasm-rust-pres
Slides for WASM, Rust, and the State of Async/Await.

On November 12th/13th, I gave a presentation on **using WebAssemebly to write backend web applications** at the **Utah Rust** Meetup. The presentation and demos are based on the much-larger website/knowledgebase https://slightknack.dev that I [wrote](https://github.com/slightknack/website) a while back. (It implements versioning, a custom database controller, and a routing graph, among other things). The original meetup link can be found [here](https://www.meetup.com/utah-rust/events/273757338/) â€“ The slides are also [availiable online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cGBil9FRQVijJ5XCWkBS9AMJXsKHvaPDNGFb3IueWQA/edit?usp=sharing) ([as a PDF](https://github.com/slightknack/wasm-rust-pres/blob/master/presentation.pdf)) for your convinience.

This repository also contains the source code used for the above demos - they should work out of the box, once you have Wrangler installed and configured and have created the requisite namespaces where applicable. To install `wrangler` (if you have `cargo` installed) and run the template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasm-rust-pres
cd wasm-rust-pres/rust-worker-template
cargo install wrangler
# set up wrangler
wrangler dev
```

Once the recording of the talk has been uploaded, I'll add the recorded talk.
